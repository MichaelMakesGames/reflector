Orignally created for 7DRL 2019, this game is now under active development.

## Gameplay

The core mechanic of the game is the manipulation of the lasers using reflectors and splitters. Your weapons recharge slowly and the enemies are plentiful, so you need to plan your shots to take out multiple at once.

## Running the Game

Assuming you have npm installed on your system, `npm install` and `npm run`. Then the game will be available at `localhost:1234`.
